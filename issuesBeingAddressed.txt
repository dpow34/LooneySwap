KNOWN ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------------------
SOME COINS NEED TO BE DISABLED IN DROPDOWN - WHEN SRC IS X COIN, THEN ONLY SOME COINS WORK FOR CONVERSION - more testing needs to be done

Errors when building transactions with certain tokens

Would like to make it where if same token is selected in 2nd drop down then first drop down goes blank

Accuracy needs to be checked for succesful conversions. Tough because hard to find value of token on Ropsten.
ETH -> DAI gives same value as Charlie's swap (good)

Clean up code!!!!!!     

CONFUSED IF FIXED: Decimal point in wrong place for some exchanges

-----------------------------------------------------------
FIXED ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------------------
FIXED w/ error handling:
ELF 
MANA 
ZRX 
SNX 
WBTC 
CSAI 
CBAT 
WETH -> computePrice error no matter the value
sBTC -> same as WETH



If src token value is a decimal value, and then you highlight and type a decimal, input won't work becuase
it thinks you're typing 2 decimals (not allowed). Example: If 5.55 is entered in src text box, then if you highlight
it and type a decimal point as the first value it won't do anything.

Can't paste values into src text box

If src and dest token are same token, program just does nothing. I'd like to get it where it eliminates selected token
from other dropdown like Uniswap. Example: If you select ETH for src, then ETH should not be able to be selected in dest. 



Users should not have to click off the input text box to get conversion. Should do it as the user is entering values.
