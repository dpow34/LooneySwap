These coins are giving errors:
ELF -> shows conversion, but shows 400 Bad Request in console
MANA -> same as ELF
ZRX -> same as ELF
SNX -> same as ELF
WBTC -> possibly because 8 instead of 18 for smallest denomination (probably not though)
CSAI -> same as WBTC
CBAT -> same as WBTC
WETH
SBTC

Accuracy needs to be checked for succesful conversions. Tough because hard to find value of token on Ropsten.
ETH -> DAI gives same value as Charlie's swap (good)

If src token value is a decimal value, and then you highlight and type a decimal, input won't work becuase
it thinks you're typing 2 decimals (not allowed). Example: If 5.55 is entered in src text box, then if you highlight
it and type a decimal point as the first value it won't do anything.

Can't paste values into src text box

If src and dest token are same token, program just does nothing. I'd like to get it where it eliminates selected token
from other dropdown like Uniswap. Example: If you select ETH for src, then ETH should not be able to be selected in dest.

Users should not have to click off the input text box to get conversion. Should do it as the user is entering values.

Clean up code.
